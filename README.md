# Netflix Clone

## Overview

This project is a **Netflix Clone** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The purpose of this project is to practice and improve my frontend development skills. The website is a static representation of the Netflix homepage, focusing on the layout and design.

## Features

- **Simple Layout:** A basic recreation of the Netflix homepage using pure HTML and CSS.
- **Static Content:** The content is hard-coded for now, with no dynamic features or backend support.
- **Non-Responsive Design:** Currently, the website is not responsive. It is best viewed on desktop screens.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to learn and grow in web development, I plan to make the following improvements:

- **Responsive Design:** I will update the website to be fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
- **Advanced CSS Techniques:** Incorporating more advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid for better layout management.
